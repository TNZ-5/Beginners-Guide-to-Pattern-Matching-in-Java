🔍🧩 Pattern Matching in Java: Understanding Regular Expressions 🧠🔎

Introduction 📝👋:
Regular expressions, commonly known as regex, are powerful tools used in Java and many other programming languages to perform pattern matching. They provide a concise and flexible way to search, match, and manipulate strings based on specific patterns. In this repo, we will dive into the world of regular expressions in Java and explore how to form them step-by-step while understanding the meaning of each item.

Step 1: Basic Literals 🔠🔢:
The simplest regular expression consists of ordinary characters that represent themselves. For example, the regex "hello" will match the exact string "hello" in the input. It is essential to understand that regular expressions are case-sensitive by default.

Step 2: Metacharacters 🌟🎭:
Metacharacters add the magic to regular expressions. They are special characters that represent a group of characters or perform specific actions.

1. "." (dot) - Matches any character except a newline.
2. "^" (caret) - Matches the start of a line.
3. "$" (dollar) - Matches the end of a line.
4. "\b" - Matches a word boundary.
5. "\d" - Matches any digit (0-9).
6. "\D" - Matches any non-digit character.
7. "\w" - Matches any word character (alphanumeric and underscore).
8. "\W" - Matches any non-word character.
9. "\s" - Matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline).
10. "\S" - Matches any non-whitespace character.

Step 3: Character Classes 👥👥:
Character classes are enclosed in square brackets and allow you to match any single character from the defined set.

1. "[abc]" - Matches either 'a', 'b', or 'c'.
2. "[a-z]" - Matches any lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z'.
3. "[A-Z]" - Matches any uppercase letter from 'A' to 'Z'.
4. "[0-9]" - Matches any digit from 0 to 9.
5. "[^abc]" - Matches any character except 'a', 'b', or 'c'.

Step 4: Quantifiers 🔢📈:
Quantifiers specify how many times the previous character or group should occur.

1. "*" - Matches zero or more occurrences.
2. "+" - Matches one or more occurrences.
3. "?" - Matches zero or one occurrence.
4. "{n}" - Matches exactly 'n' occurrences.
5. "{n,}" - Matches 'n' or more occurrences.
6. "{n,m}" - Matches between 'n' and 'm' occurrences.

Step 5: Escaping Special Characters ↪️🔗:
Sometimes, you need to match the metacharacters themselves, like matching a literal dot or dollar sign. In such cases, you must escape the special characters using a backslash "\".

Step 6: Groups and Capturing 👥🎯:
Parentheses "()" are used to create groups and capture matched substrings. This can be helpful for extracting specific parts of the matched text.

Step 7: Alternation 🔀🔄:
The pipe symbol "|" allows for alternation, which means either the expression on the left or the one on the right can be matched.

Conclusion 🏁📝:
Regular expressions in Java are a powerful tool for pattern matching and string manipulation. By combining literals, metacharacters, character classes, quantifiers, and escaping, you can create intricate patterns to match specific strings. Understanding the meaning and functionality of each item in a regular expression empowers you to write efficient and accurate pattern matching code in Java. Happy coding! 🚀💻
